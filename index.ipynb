    "#### 2. Build and Evaluate a Baseline Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Without performing any preprocessing or hyperparameter tuning, build and evaluate a vanilla logistic regression model using log loss and `cross_val_score`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Write a Custom Cross Validation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are using preprocessing techniques that differ for train and validation data, we will need a custom function rather than simply preprocessing the entire `X_train` and using `cross_val_score` from scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Build and Evaluate Additional Logistic Regression Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the function created in the previous step, build multiple logistic regression models with different hyperparameters in order to minimize log loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Choose and Evaluate a Final Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocess the full training set and test set appropriately, then evaluate the final model with various classification metrics in addition to log loss."

After that, you tuned the model through adjusting the regularization strength and the gradient descent hyperparameters. Finally, you evaluated your final model on log loss as well as more user-friendly metrics."
